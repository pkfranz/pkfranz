# About this website

This is the 2020 version of my professional portfolio. It is a Jekyll site served with GitHub Pages. It's based on [HTML5 UP's](https://html5up.net/) work available through Creative Commons.  They make building beautiful and fast-performing websites a breeze.

## SSL documentation

This site is secured through Cloudflare. The full documentation on getting an SSL certification to work on a custom GitHub domain is here (works like a charm):

In short, GitHub needs to better support SSL because the Cloudflare method is a workaround. Given that [Google is now boosting](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2014/08/https-as-ranking-signal.html) results for https-secured sites, this is ever more important. Don't be a loser and leave your website unsecured.
