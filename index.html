								<h2>Narrative Storytelling<br />
								Through Motion and Photography</h2>
								<p>I've traveled the world telling personal stories in Haiti, Eastern Europe, and Asia. I started as a one-man band, writing, shooting, and editing. I create documentaries and short videos from start to finish. <a href="https://www.vimeo.com/pkfranz" target="_blank">Visit my Vimeo portfolio.</a></p>

								<h2>Motion Design<br />
								For Effortless Viewer Comprehension</h2>
								<p>Sometimes original video or photography can't cut it alone, or the story just doesn't lend itself to a documentary. I produce animations and motion graphics to explain some of the most complex stories.</p>

								<h2>Immersive and informative<br />
								visualizations that break down complexity</h2>
								<p>No visual project is complete without a focus on interactivity and presentation on the web. Effective visualization helps explain complex ideas. <a href="http://shortyawards.com/9th/commission-on-countering-violent-extremism-cve-interactive-map" target="_blank">I won the Shorty Award in 2017 for best data visualization</a>, beating out competition from Google, Uber, and NBC News.</p>
